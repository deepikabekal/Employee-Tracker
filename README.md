# Employee-Tracker

## Description
Developers frequently have to create interfaces that make it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called content management systems (CMS). This is a command-line application to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.
